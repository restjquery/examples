# RESTjQuery Examples

This repository provides examples on how to use the [restjQuery](https://github.com/restjquery/RESTjQuery) script. Each example also provides javascript ready made for you to copy and paste into your projects.

These examples show how to use the script parameters, apply body classes based on the post content, only load content elements that exists and lazy load the featured image if one has been assigned to the post.

Each example is well documented and easy to understand. How you go about using the examples is up to you but they should give you a head start in implementing into your WordPress projects using the REST API via jQuery.

> More examples will be added over time.
